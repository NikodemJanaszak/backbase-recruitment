**Assumptions**

<p>Before I started solving challenge, I was planning to use technologies which you recommend.<p>

<p>I intended to use newest technologies according to your recommendation.
During the challenge I could have learned some new for me Spring Boot features.
That's what I assumed.</p>

<p>Another point is. I wanted to deliver fast working app and don't do overcomplicated solution.
The idea of a final solution has been with me since I started.</p>
