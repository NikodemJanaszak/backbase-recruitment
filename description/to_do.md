**Things I would add to my solution if I have more time and what is missing in solution**

* extend database and add entities for user for more advanced authentication
* develop more complex user service for authentication and authorization
* above also goes with improved API token generating and verifying
* good way is to deliver some basic frontend to avoid requesting over Postman app
* use one of DBMS like PostgreSQL, Oracle Database or MySQL fo example
